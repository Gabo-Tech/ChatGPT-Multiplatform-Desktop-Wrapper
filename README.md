# GPT Desktop for Linux - A Wrapper for OpenAI's GPT

![GPT Desktop for Linux](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/placeholder-image.png)

**GPT Desktop for Linux** is an open-source project that provides Linux users with a seamless experience to run OpenAI's GPT desktop application. Since OpenAI officially released desktop versions for macOS and Windows, this project bridges the gap for Linux users by building a lightweight wrapper using **Tauri** and **JavaScript**.

## Features

- üñ•Ô∏è **Native Linux Support**: A desktop experience optimized for Linux distributions.
- ‚ö° **Lightweight & Fast**: Built with Tauri, ensuring minimal resource usage and a snappy interface.
- üîí **Secure**: Fully respects your privacy with no data tracking.
- üöÄ **Open Source**: Contributions are welcome to enhance functionality.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **npm** (or `yarn`)
- **Rust** (for building Tauri apps)
- A Linux distribution (tested on Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, and others)

### Download & Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gabo-Tech/ChatGPT-Multiplatform-Desktop-Wrapper.git
